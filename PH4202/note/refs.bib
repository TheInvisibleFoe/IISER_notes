              all of which possess very special symmetry properties, have with
              the generic nonintegrable models that are used to describe real
              experiments, which do not have the symmetry properties, is one of
              the most fundamental open questions in both statistical mechanics
              and quantum ﬁeld theory. The importance of the two-dimensional
              Ising model in a magnetic ﬁeld is that it is the simplest system
              where this relationship may be concretely studied. We here review
              the advances made in this study, and concentrate on the magnetic
              susceptibility which has revealed an unexpected natural boundary
              phenomenon. When this is combined with the Fermionic
              representations of conformal characters, it is suggested that the
              scaling theory, which smoothly connects the lattice with the
              correlation length scale, may be incomplete for H 6= 0.},

              theory to determine a magnetisation function, and the results of
              the derivation are interpreted graphically, physically, and
              mathematically. We give a new interpretation of the
              self-consistency condition in terms of intersecting surfaces and
              constrained solution sets. We also include some more general
              comments on the thermodynamics of the phase transition. We end by
              evaluating symmetry considerations in magnetisation, and some more
              subtle features of the Ising model. Together, a self-contained
              overview of the mean field Ising model is given, with some novel
              presentation of important results.},
