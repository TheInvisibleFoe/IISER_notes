#figure(image("assets/fsb_all.png", width: 55%), caption: [Fringe shift vs $beta$ for all three data sets. The slopes of the fits are $0.50 pm 0.02$, $0.49 pm 0.02$, and $0.51 pm 0.02$ for Data Sets 1, 2, and 3 respectively, all of which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of $0.5$.])
