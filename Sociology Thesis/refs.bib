  abstract  = "The past two decades have been years of temendous social and
               political change in most Western democracies, as the student
               movement, citizen action groups, and other new social movements
               challenged the established political order. Discussions of a
               ``successor generation'' reflect a growing belief that members
               of these new political groups have begun the long march through
               the institutions, altering the composition of political elites
               as the march progresses. This article examines the topic of
               generational change with a study of European party elites drawn
               from the 1979 European election study project. We first describe
               the generational differences in elite issue priorities and
               policy attitudes. Although these differences are quite modest, a
               much greater change is found in the extent of Left/Right issue
               polarization across age groups. The results provide a basis for
               speculating about the future course of political competition in
               Western European societies.",

  abstract  = "Disagreements over whether polarization exists in the mass
               public have confounded two separate types of polarization. When
               social polarization is separated from issue position
               polarization, both sides of the polarization debate can be
               simultaneously correct. Social polarization, characterized by
               increased levels of partisan bias, activism, and anger, is
               increasing, driven by partisan identity and political identity
               alignment, and does not require the same magnitude of issue
               position polarization. The partisan-ideological sorting that has
               occurred in recent decades has caused the nation as a whole to
               hold more aligned political identities, which has strengthened
               partisan identity and the activism, bias, and anger that result
               from strong identities, even though issue positions have not
               undergone the same degree of polarization. The result is a
               nation that agrees on many things but is bitterly divided
               nonetheless. An examination of ANES data finds strong support
               for these hypotheses.",

  abstract  = "Can political polarization, typically viewed as detrimental for
               political development, have positive effects on
               institution-building and democratization in the long run? This
               article argues that the overall impact of polarization on a
               political system is determined by two factors: the character of
               preexisting identity cleavages and the balance of forces between
               groups on either side of the political divide. Where there
               exists a history of formal group exclusion or differential
               citizenship rights, political polarization is more likely to
               result in large-scale violence and democratic breakdown. Where
               power is strongly imbalanced, on the other hand, polarization is
               unlikely to be sustained, and the status quo ante will be
               retained. When these two conditions are absent, however, a
               relatively high degree of polarization can have surprising
               institution-building effects for new democracies. The article
               illustrates these arguments with reference to four key cases in

  abstract  = "We develop a model in which profits of media firms depend on
               their audience ratings, and maximizing profits may involve
               catering to a partisan audience by suppressing information that
               the partisan audience does not like hearing. While voters are
               rational, understand the nature of the news suppression bias and
               update appropriately, important information is lost through bias
               and can lead to electoral mistakes. We characterize those
               conditions that give rise to electoral mistakes, showing that
               heightened political polarization and asymmetric distributions
               of voter ideologies make electoral mistakes more likely. Even if
               the median ideology is a centrist and centrist voters gain
               access to unbiased news, media bias can generate excessive
               ``cross-over'' voting, which, in turn, can lead to the election

               more politicized newspapers have more extreme political
               preferences. This polarization effect of media is mainly driven
               by individuals who harbor liberal opinions reading more
               newspapers, as opposed to individuals endorsing rather
               conservative positions. More politicized media also reinforce
               other aspects of citizens' political sophistication such as
               political knowledge. This enhanced political sophistication
               materializes in observable involvement in politics, measured by

               issue-based terms, a new type of division has emerged in the
               mass public in recent years: Ordinary Americans increasingly
               dislike and distrust those from the other party. Democrats and
               Republicans both say that the other party's members are
               hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling
               to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity
               between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace
               its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity,
               and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also
               explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting

               has contributed to political polarization and led Americans to
               support more partisan policies and candidates. Congress and some
               newer media outlets have added more partisan messages to a
               continuing supply of mostly centrist news. Although political
               attitudes of most Americans have remained fairly moderate,
               evidence points to some polarization among the politically
               involved. Proliferation of media choices lowered the share of
               less interested, less partisan voters and thereby made elections
               more partisan. But evidence for a causal link between more
               partisan messages and changing attitudes or behaviors is mixed
               at best. Measurement problems hold back research on partisan
               selective exposure and its consequences. Ideologically one-sided
               news exposure may be largely confined to a small, but highly
               involved and influential, segment of the population. There is no
               firm evidence that partisan media are making ordinary Americans
