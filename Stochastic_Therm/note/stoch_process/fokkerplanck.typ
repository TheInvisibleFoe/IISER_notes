= Fokker-Planck Equation

The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of a stochastic process.

== Single Variable Fokker-Planck Equation

The Fokker-Planck equation for a single variable $x$ is given by:
$
  pdv(pr,t) = lfp pr = - pdv(x,t) A(x) pr + 1/2 pdv(x,x,2) B(x) pr
$
