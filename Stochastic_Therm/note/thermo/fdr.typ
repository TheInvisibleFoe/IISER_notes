= Fluctuation Dissipation Relation
In the regime of linear response theoery, we consider systems, which are driven slightly out of equilibrium by a time-dependent manipulation. We assume that the observables deviate from their equilibrium values with linear dependence on the manipulation.

#td([
  Need to read the derivation of the Fluctuation Dissipation Relation from the generalized Langevin equation.
])

Following < PP >, this derivation is done in the context of Stochastic thermodynamics. Suppose that the energy of a state $x$ can be manipulated in $r$ different ways. We denote the manipulation parameters by $ll = (ll_aa), aa=1,...,r$. Again, under the assumption of linear response, the energies deviate linearly from their unperturbed values,
$
  eps_x (ll) = eps_(x) - sum_(aa =1)^r ll_aa X_(aa,x)
$
