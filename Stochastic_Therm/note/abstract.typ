The Ising Model was introduced by Wilhelm Lenz along with his PhD student Ernest Ising. At that time it sought to explain the concept of ferromagnetism using a simple model that involved interaction with nearest neighbors. This report details out some of the models that were exactly solved in a quest for a solution to the Ising Model. Starting out with Ising's own Solution to the 1D Model,we move on the Mean field Model, and then finally arrive at a solution to the 2D Ising Model. The solution here is by Baxter @baxter1982, and is based on an article by Onsager in @mills1971. It solves the problem by using commuting transfer matrices obtained by constructing the lattice diagonally. This report arrives at the end to the free energy of the 2D Ising Model, and then uses that to calculate the critical temperature of the model. Finally, some Monte Carlo simulations are done to verify the results obtained theoretically. We also observe some numerical properties of the model using these simulations.
