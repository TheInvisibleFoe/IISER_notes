This is a collection of my Notes for the course Non Linear Dynamics (PH4104) given at IISER Kolkata. We start with 1D systems and move on to higher dimensions. The main topics covered are Fixed Points, Stability Analysis, Bifurcations, Limit Cycles and Chaos. Then we move onto Maps and Fractals. After, this we move onto Hamiltonian Systems and the KAM theorem. We then cover some nonlinear PDEs and Solitons. Finally we end with some topics in nonlinear PDEs.
